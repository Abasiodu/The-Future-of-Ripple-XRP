## 3. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and Stablecoins:
- **🌍 CBDCs:** Pilots with Bhutan and Palau.
- **💵 Stablecoins:** Issuing USDS and AUDC on the XRP Ledger.
- **💡 Impact on XRP:** More activity on the public ledger could benefit XRP, but impact is currently minimal.

## 4. NFTs and Metaverse:

- **🌐 Root Network:** New blockchain project using XRP for gas fees and validator payments.
- **📈 Impact on XRP:** Increased NFT and metaverse activity could boost XRP use, especially with Root Network integration.

## 🔍 Conclusion:
